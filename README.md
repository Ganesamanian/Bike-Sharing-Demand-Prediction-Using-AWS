## Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Using AWS

This repository contains code for predicting bike sharing demand using machine learning models within the AWS (Amazon Web Services) environment. The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle, and you can download it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/data).

### Introduction

Bike sharing systems are a convenient mode of transportation in many cities around the world. Accurate prediction of bike demand is essential for optimizing the availability and distribution of bikes. In this project, we explore various machine learning models within the AWS ecosystem to predict bike sharing demand based on historical data.

### Data Analysis<a name="data-analysis"></a>

In the initial phase, we perform data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This includes:

- Understanding the dimensions of the dataset.
- Exploring data types of features.
- Handling missing data.
- Visualizing correlations between features and the target variable.

### Data Preprocessing<a name="data-preprocessing"></a>

Data preprocessing is a crucial step to prepare the dataset for machine learning models. This involves:

- Converting date-time data to separate year, month, day, and hour features.
- Scaling or normalizing features.
- Handling categorical variables.
- Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.

### Model Building<a name="model-building"></a>

We experiment with various machine learning models, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

### Training and Validation<a name="training-and-validation"></a>

We split the dataset into training and validation sets to train and evaluate our models within the AWS SageMaker environment. Key performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Explained Variance Score are used to assess the model's accuracy.

### Testing<a name="testing"></a>

Once the models are trained and validated, we apply them to the test dataset to predict bike sharing demand. The results are then analyzed and compared.

### Model Deployment<a name="model-deployment"></a>

The models are built and trained within the AWS SageMaker environment using the provided code. To train the models, we use data stored in an AWS S3 bucket. The trained models and artifacts are saved in the S3 bucket for potential deployment in a production environment. This allows for easy access and integration into other applications.

#### Running the Repository Locally

To clone and run this repository locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bike-sharing-demand-prediction.git
   ```

2. Change to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd bike-sharing-demand-prediction
   ```

3. Set up your Python environment. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate"
   ```

4. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Modify the dataset paths and AWS configurations in the code to match your own S3 bucket and file locations.

6. Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to run the code and train the models.

#### AWS Configuration

To use this code with AWS services, you need to set up an AWS account, configure your IAM role, and create an S3 bucket for storing data and model artifacts. Ensure you have the necessary AWS CLI credentials and permissions set up on your local machine.
